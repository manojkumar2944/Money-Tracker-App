# Money Tracker Web App using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB

This project is a money tracker web app designed to help users manage their expenses and income. The front-end, developed with HTML and CSS, provides a simple and intuitive interface. Node.js and Express power the back-end, while MongoDB is used for secure data storage. Users can track their financial transactions, categorize expenses, and monitor their income, giving them a clear overview of their finances. The app combines front-end design with a robust back-end for efficient money management.
